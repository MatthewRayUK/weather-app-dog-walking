# Weather Forecast for Dog Walks 🌦️🐕

This app was created to help me decide the best times to walk my dog based on the weather. Every morning, it checks the forecast for specific times throughout the day (9am, 12pm, 3pm, and 6pm) and sends a message to my Facebook telling me whether it's likely to rain or stay dry. That way, I can plan the perfect time for a walk without getting caught in the rain!
